## 2. API Documentation

The project lacks formal API documentation for its modules and classes.

### 2.1. Undocumented Module: `run_playwright_scraper.py`

- **Location/Component**: `run_playwright_scraper.py`
- **Type of Documentation Missing**: Module-level and function-level docstrings.

    - A module-level docstring explaining the purpose of the script.
    - Docstrings for each function, detailing its purpose, arguments, and return values.
- **Example Documentation Snippet**:
    ```python
    """
    Playwright-based web scraper for dynamic websites.

    This script launches a headless browser to scrape websites that heavily rely on
    JavaScript for content rendering. It includes anti-detection measures to mimic
    a real user.
    """

    def create_output_directory(url: str) -> str:
        """
        Creates a timestamped output directory for a scraping job.

        Args:
            url: The URL being scraped, used to generate the directory name.

        Returns:
            The path to the created directory.
        """
        # ...
    ```

### 2.2. Undocumented Class: `PlaywrightScraper`

    ```python
    class PlaywrightScraper:
        """
        A scraper that uses Playwright to handle JavaScript-rich websites.

        This class manages the browser instance, page navigation, data extraction,
        and result saving.
        """

        async def setup_browser(self) -> Browser:
            """
            Initializes and configures the Playwright browser instance.

            Returns:
                A configured Playwright Browser instance.
            """
            # ...
    ```

## 3. Code Comments

Some complex parts of the codebase could benefit from inline comments.

### 3.1. Complex Logic: Anti-Detection Measures

- **Location/Component**: `run_playwright_scraper.py`, `create_page` method
- **Type of Documentation Missing**: Inline comments explaining anti-detection techniques.
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Suggested Documentation Content Outline**:
    - Comments explaining why specific Playwright options and JavaScript overrides are used.
- **Example Documentation Snippet**:
    ```python
    async def create_page(self, browser: Browser) -> Page:
        """Create a new page with anti-detection measures."""
        context = await browser.new_context(
            # ...
        )
        
        page = await context.new_page()
        
        # Add a script to be executed on every page load to bypass bot detection
        await page.add_init_script('''
            // Override the navigator.webdriver property to hide automation
            Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'webdriver', {
                get: () => undefined
            });
        ''')
        
        return page
    ```

## 4. User Guides

The project would be more user-friendly with dedicated guides for common tasks.

### 4.1. Missing Guide: Troubleshooting

- **Location/Component**: New file: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- **Type of Documentation Missing**: Troubleshooting Guide
- **Priority**: High
- **Suggested Documentation Content Outline**:
    - Common issues and their solutions (e.g., "No items found," "Browser not found").
    - Instructions on how to run scrapers in debug mode.
    - Tips for handling different types of websites.
- **Example Documentation Snippet**:
    ```markdown
    # Troubleshooting Guide

    ## Issue: No Items Found

    If the scraper runs but doesn't find any items, try the following:

    - **For the Scrapy scraper**: The CSS selectors in `super_scraper/spiders/universal.py` might not match the target website's structure. You may need to inspect the website's HTML and update the `item_selectors`.
    - **For Playwright/Pydoll scrapers**: The website might require a login or other interaction before displaying content. Try running the scraper with `headless=False` to observe its behavior.
    ```

## 5. Architecture Documentation

A high-level overview of the project's architecture would help new developers understand the codebase.

### 5.1. Missing Overview: System Architecture

- **Location/Component**: New file: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Type of Documentation Missing**: Architecture Overview
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Suggested Documentation Content Outline**:
    - A diagram showing the relationship between the different scrapers, the Scrapy engine, and the output files.
    - A description of the data flow from the target website to the final CSV file.
- **Example Documentation Snippet**:
    ```markdown
    # Architecture Overview

    The Super Scraper Suite is composed of three main components:

    1.  **Scrapy Engine**: The core of the `run_scraper.py` script, handling concurrent requests, the data pipeline, and item processing.
    2.  **Browser Automation (Playwright/Pydoll)**: Used by `run_playwright_scraper.py` and `run_pydoll_scraper.py` to control a web browser for scraping dynamic content.
    3.  **Shared Components**: All scrapers use a common output format and directory structure.

    ## Data Flow

    Target Website -> Scraper (Scrapy/Playwright/Pydoll) -> Item Pipeline (Validation, Deduplication) -> CSV File
    ```

## 6. Type Definitions

While some type hints are present, their usage could be more consistent.

### 6.1. Missing Type Hints: `run_scraper.py`

- **Location/Component**: `run_scraper.py`
- **Type of Documentation Missing**: Function type hints.
- **Priority**: Low
- **Suggested Documentation Content Outline**:
    - Add type hints to function signatures for better code clarity and static analysis.
- **Example Documentation Snippet**:
    ```python
    def create_output_directory(url: str) -> str:
        # ...

    def run_spider(url: str, output_file: str, log_level: str, log_file: str = None) -> None:
        # ...
    ```
