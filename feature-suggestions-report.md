# Feature Suggestions Report

This report outlines potential new features for the Super Scraper Suite. Each feature is detailed with its rationale, user stories, technical requirements, and implementation complexity.

## 1. Centralized Configuration File

### Feature Description
Instead of relying solely on command-line arguments, introduce a centralized configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml` or `config.ini`) to manage scraper settings, target URLs, and other parameters. This would allow users to define and manage multiple scraping tasks more efficiently.

### Business Value/Rationale
- **Improved Usability:** Simplifies the process of running scrapers with complex configurations.
- **Reusability:** Allows users to save and reuse configurations for different scraping tasks.
- **Scalability:** Makes it easier to manage a large number of scraping jobs.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to define all my scraper settings in a single file so that I don't have to type long commands every time.
- As a user, I want to manage configurations for multiple websites in one place.

### Technical Requirements
- A new module to parse the configuration file (e.g., using `PyYAML` or `configparser`).
- Modify the scraper scripts to read settings from the configuration file.
- Command-line arguments should override the settings from the configuration file.

### Implementation Complexity
- **Simple**

### Dependencies on Existing Code
- `run_scraper.py`, `run_playwright_scraper.py`, `run_pydoll_scraper.py`

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1.  Choose a configuration format (e.g., YAML).
2.  Create a `config.yaml.example` file with all possible settings.
3.  Implement a function to load the configuration file.
4.  Update the `main` function in each scraper script to load the configuration.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Need to handle missing or invalid configuration files gracefully.

## 2. Proxy Support

### Feature Description
Add support for using HTTP/HTTPS proxies to route scraping requests through different IP addresses. This is essential for avoiding IP-based blocking and for scraping websites that are geographically restricted.

### Business Value/Rationale
- **Improved Reliability:** Reduces the risk of being blocked by target websites.
- **Anonymity:** Allows users to scrape websites without revealing their own IP address.
- **Access to Geo-restricted Content:** Enables scraping of content that is only available in specific regions.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to provide a list of proxies to be used for scraping so that I can avoid being blocked.
- As a user, I want to be able to rotate proxies for each request.

### Technical Requirements
- For the Scrapy scraper, this can be implemented using a custom downloader middleware.
- For the Playwright and Pydoll scrapers, the browser needs to be launched with proxy settings.
- The configuration should support single proxies, lists of proxies, and authenticated proxies.

### Implementation Complexity
- **Moderate**

### Dependencies on Existing Code
- `super_scraper/settings.py`, `run_playwright_scraper.py`, `run_pydoll_scraper.py`

### Suggested Implementation Approach
- **Scrapy:** Create a custom downloader middleware that sets the `proxy` meta key for each request.
- **Playwright:** Use the `proxy` option when launching the browser.
- **Pydoll:** Pydoll's underlying browser automation library should support proxy settings.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Proxies can be unreliable and may introduce another point of failure.
- Need to handle proxy authentication securely.

## 3. Database Integration

### Feature Description
Provide an option to save scraped data directly to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) instead of just a CSV file.

### Business Value/Rationale
- **Persistent Storage:** Databases provide a more robust and scalable solution for storing large amounts of data.
- **Easier Data Analysis:** Storing data in a database makes it easier to query and analyze.
- **Integration with Other Systems:** Allows other applications to easily access the scraped data.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to save my scraped data to a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose the output format (CSV or database) when running a scraper.

### Technical Requirements
- Add new item pipelines for each supported database.
- Use libraries like `SQLAlchemy` for SQL databases and `pymongo` for MongoDB.
- The database connection settings should be configurable.

### Implementation Complexity
- **Moderate**

### Dependencies on Existing Code
- `super_scraper/pipelines.py`, `super_scraper/settings.py`

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1.  Create a new pipeline for each database (e.g., `PostgresPipeline`, `MongoPipeline`).
2.  The pipeline will be responsible for connecting to the database and inserting the items.
3.  The user can enable the desired pipeline in the settings.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Need to handle database connection errors.
- Database schema management can be complex.

## 4. Web-based User Interface (UI)

### Feature Description
A simple web-based UI to manage scraping jobs, view results, and configure scrapers. This would make the tool more accessible to non-technical users.

### Business Value/Rationale
- **Improved User Experience:** A UI would make the tool much easier to use.
- **Accessibility:** Allows users who are not comfortable with the command line to use the scraper.
- **Centralized Management:** Provides a single place to manage all scraping activities.

### User Stories
- As a non-technical user, I want to be able to start a scraping job by filling out a form in a web interface.
- As a user, I want to view the results of my scraping jobs in a table in the UI.

### Technical Requirements
- A web framework like Flask or FastAPI for the backend.
- A simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The backend would need to execute the scraper scripts as subprocesses.

### Implementation Complexity
- **Complex**

### Dependencies on Existing Code
- The UI would need to interact with the existing scraper scripts.

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1.  Create a new Flask/FastAPI application.
2.  Create API endpoints to start, stop, and monitor scraping jobs.
3.  Create a simple frontend with a form to start a new job and a table to display the results.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Managing subprocesses and their state can be challenging.
- Security considerations for a web-based interface.

## 5. Scheduling and Automation

### Feature Description
Add the ability to schedule scraping jobs to run at specific times or intervals. This would be useful for monitoring websites for changes or for collecting data over time.

### Business Value/Rationale
- **Automation:** Automates the process of running scrapers regularly.
- **Data Monitoring:** Enables users to monitor websites for changes in prices, stock availability, etc.
- **Time-series Data Collection:** Allows for the collection of data over time for trend analysis.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to schedule my scraper to run every day at 9 AM.
- As a user, I want to be notified when the price of a product changes.

### Technical Requirements
- A scheduling library like `APScheduler` or `schedule`.
- The scheduler would need to be integrated into the main application or run as a separate process.
- The scheduling configuration should be manageable through the configuration file or the UI.

### Implementation Complexity
- **Moderate**

### Dependencies on Existing Code
- The scheduler would need to be able to trigger the existing scraper scripts.

### Suggested Implementation Approach
1.  Integrate a scheduling library into the application.
2.  Add a new section to the configuration file for defining schedules.
3.  The scheduler would read the configuration and trigger the scrapers accordingly.

### Potential Risks or Considerations
- Managing long-running scheduled jobs can be complex.
- Need to handle overlapping job executions.
